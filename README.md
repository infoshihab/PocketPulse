# 📌 PocketPuls

**PocketPuls** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project that you developed. It includes a backend API and a frontend user interface, and it represents a complete web application built using modern JavaScript technologies.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

PocketPulse is a web application built with the **MERN stack**, where:

* **Frontend** is built with **React.js** (for UI and user interactions).
* **Backend** is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** (for REST API and server logic).
* **MongoDB** is used for data storage.
* The project showcases your ability to build a real-world web application with frontend and backend connected.

This project demonstrates your practical skills in full-stack web development and backend API design. It also shows your understanding of modern development workflows like separation of concerns between client and server, environment configuration, routing, and database interactions.
